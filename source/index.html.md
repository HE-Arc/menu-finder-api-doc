# Introduction

Welcome to the MenuFinder API! You can use our API to get various informations about the menus proposed by our registered restaurant owners.
This API tries to follow the [json:api](https://jsonapi.org/) specifications as much as possible.

As you will probably notice, our API currently support only ``GET `` requests.

This API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate).

## API Status
**This is the beta (unstable) version of our REST API**. There will probably be breaking changes until v1 is released.
